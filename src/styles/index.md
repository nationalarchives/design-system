Make services look and feel like The National Archives.

If you are using the GOV.UK Prototype Kit with TNA Frontend or have TNA Frontend included in your build, the coded examples in the Design System will not need any additional styling.

If you need to apply styles manually, you should still follow existing National Archives conventions. For example, do not assign new meanings to colours, do not change the style of buttons or adjust the thickness of borders on form inputs.
