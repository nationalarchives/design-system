## Showcase professionalism

1. Avoid using cheesy graphics, generative AI, stock photography, icons and unnecessary animation to add visual interest.
1. Enable more support for technologies that allow a pure browsing experience such as reader modes.
1. Follow editorial and content guidelines and don't rely on AI to write copy.
1. Don’t write titles that look like clickbait.
1. Provide links and references to trusted sources.

## Grow trust

1. Respect the user's choices, including their preference to remain anonymous.
1. Track only with explicit consent and assume an incognito browsing experience is needed unless beneficial to the user to offer otherwise.
1. Give users full control and place them in the driving seat.
1. Provide transparency about the use of data.
1. Clearly declare where and how AI has been used.

## Include everyone

1. Design and build services that support everyone.
1. Don’t limit inclusion to a checkbox exercise of WCAG compliance.
1. Consider users without access to the latest technologies.
1. Add simple introductions and explanations for non-expert users.
1. Avoid using product names that don’t properly describe the service.

## Think forwards

1. Where possible, build services that can be more easily updated or replaced.
1. Split complex functionality up into discrete services or pages.
1. Explore and use new technologies as an enhancement but plan for their obsolescence.
1. Push small, incremental updates often rather than large changes less frequently.
1. Plan for the future and create content and structure under URLs that will stand the test of time.

## Build robustness

1. Design services that can work in any network conditions and optimise for performance.
1. Consider users that have limited access.
1. Where possible, make page URLs sharable and stateless.
1. Be wary of relying on third party services and prepare for situations when they might not be reachable.
1. Build services that inspire confidence.
