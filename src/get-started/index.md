The examples in the National Archives Design System come with code to make it easy for you to use them in your project.

There are guides to getting started:

- [prototyping](/design-system/get-started/prototyping/)
- [production](/design-system/get-started/production/)

## Using styles, components and patterns

When something is published in the National Archives Design System as a [style](/design-system/styles/), [component](/design-system/components/) or [pattern](/design-system/patterns/) we include details of how and when it’s been tested in user research. This should help you decide whether it’s something you can use or adapt for your service.
