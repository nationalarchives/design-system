## What’s new

**21 March 2024**: We've released TNA Frontend v0.1.48

This release brings improvements to the markup of the header and footer compoents whilst also improving some aspects of tracking.

Heading sizes have been tweaked to give better consistency across all device sizes.

You can now also exit the dropdowns in the header by using the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key on your keyboard.
