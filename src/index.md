## What’s new

**26 March 2024**: We've released TNA Frontend v0.1.49

This release brings many improvements to spacing and typography. The default font sizes can be changed and now work better with font sizes defined in the browser.

The spacing between all elements is now defined relative to each other in units, for example `1`, `3`, `0.5` and the base unit can easily be changed. This means you can build interfaces that are more or less spread apart.

Read the [full release notes](https://github.com/nationalarchives/tna-frontend/releases/tag/v0.1.49) to see what’s changed.
