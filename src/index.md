## What’s new

**15 July 2024**: We’ve released TNA Frontend v0.2.0

This breaking release removes some old components (search filters and sensitive image), renames others ([files list](./components/files-list/) and [records list](./components/records-list/)) and provides a number of improvements to help reduce the size of the code.

The grid component has also been moved into utilities.

Read the [full release notes](https://github.com/nationalarchives/tna-frontend/releases/tag/v0.2.0) to see what’s changed.
