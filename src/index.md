## What’s new

**13 May 2024**: We've released TNA Frontend v0.1.53

This release brings a new optional built in theme selector. The theme selector can be added to the top of the footer. The previous release also set the light theme as the default.

There is also a new hero component style for a "split" hero, with an image beside the text.
