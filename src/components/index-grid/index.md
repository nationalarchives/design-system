Use the index grid component to display a grid of links such as displaying a list of all child pages in a hierarchy.

The index grid includes a `tna-container` element so doesnâ€™t need to be used within a column system.

{{ example({ group: "components", item: "index-grid", example: "default", html: true, nunjucks: true, size: "xxxl" }) }}

{{ status(false, 0, 2, 2, 2, false) }}

## Images

Use 3:2 aspect ratio images as the default for thumbnails on index grid items.

Thumbnails should be around 600px wide and 400px tall to ensure they display well across all screen sizes.
