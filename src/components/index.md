Components are reusable parts of the user interface that have been made to support a variety of applications.

You can use individual components in many different [patterns](/design-system/patterns/) and contexts. <!-- For example, you can use the text input component to ask for an email address, a National Insurance number or someone’s name. -->

Each component in the GOV.UK Design System has coded examples. If you’re using the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://prototype-kit.service.gov.uk/), or have included [TNA Frontend](https://github.com/nationalarchives/tna-frontend) in your build, coded examples will render the same as in the Design System.

The GOV.UK Design System’s code is public and freely available under a [Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) license](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/blob/main/LICENSE.txt). You can find our [code repositories on GitHub](https://github.com/nationalarchives), where we [code in the open](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2012/10/12/coding-in-the-open/).
